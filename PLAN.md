# üìò AcademIQ Reviewer ‚Äì Project Plan (MVP)

## 1. Core Concept
AcademIQ Reviewer is an AI-powered study platform where users can upload PDFs (each limited to 10 pages) and transform them into personalized, interactive review materials.  
It combines productivity tools (Pomodoro), AI-enhanced learning aids (flashcards, quizzes, explanations, visualization), and content transformation (podcast narration).  
Heavy processing is offloaded to APIs to reduce local resource usage, making it suitable for free hosting environments.
